## IPA Symbols in `tipa`

Here we demonstrate how to use R Markdown and \LaTeX\ together with IPA symbols:

\textipa{[\!b] [\:r] [\;B]}\quad{\tipasafemode
 $a\:a\quad b\;b\quad c\!c\quad\| $ }\quad
\textipa{[\!b] [\:r] [\;B] (back again!)}

So you can include \LaTeX\ code directly into the document as long as you include the needed packages in the `header-includes:` YAML header above.  YAML can be a little finicky with spacing so be careful up there and also make sure it begins and ends with `---` (with no spaces before them).

## More examples

```
$\llbracket$likes$\rrbracket = \lambda x. \lambda y.$ $x$ likes $y$
```

produces

$\llbracket$ likes $\rrbracket = \lambda x. \lambda y.$ $x$ likes $y$

## Define and use new environment

Just as you can create new commands, you can also create new environments.  Whenever you use `\begin{}` and `\end{}` in \LaTeX`, you are using an environment.  If you open up the `before.tex` file, you will the definition of a new \LaTeX\ environment called `boxedtext`.  Let's see an example of how to use this new environment:

\begin{boxedtext}
This is the text formatted by the boxed environment
\end{boxedtext}

## Labeling and referring to objects

### In LaTeX

Here is the way to do this in \LaTeX\.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics{sameer}
  \caption{Sameer photo}
  \label{fig:sameer}
\end{figure}

Here is a reference to the photo:  Figure \ref{fig:sameer}.

\newpage

### In R Markdown

```{r sameer2, fig.cap="Sameer photo from R Markdown", fig.align='center', fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics("sameer.jpg")
```

Here is a reference to the photo from R Markdown: Figure \ref{fig:sameer2}.
